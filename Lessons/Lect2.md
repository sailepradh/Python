## Lecture2 notes

syntax "for"

```Python
for item in alist
    do something
```

here started with the basic understanding of the function and use of the new function. Additionally we used more documentation usage of inbuilt functions. As with previous we are using to find the characterstics if each sum

we were introducted to new type of data type which is tuple () and it is a kind of list which are not immutible


list () can be done to list it

Tupple is interesting to carryb information that would go together. for example the coordinates of a point

We are still on some operation on strings. a lstrip is one example ub which in combination of letter as well. see these are on the beginning

join works in iteratble list

break --> exits the loop
continue --> jumps to first intial part of loop



## Lecture 3

We talked about the dictonary and trying to implemt matrix.

Here wer are making a basic understand of function in python

First we do the keyword and position 

there is so cool things I am learning by using function . The main theme is that we can structure the code with function such that it can be changed only in function to change all over the codes

the thing which was interseting as from like structure we can do as it can be called from the funct or the other function

when you call the function it calls the code it creates ub the function as well

```Python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    work()
```
