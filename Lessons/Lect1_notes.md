## Basic 

#### Playing eith the ''

#### anything with the \ is the special character.

#### r before the quotes means that it is some character

#### ''' in the script means that anaything in between as a comment

#### End if line are includede in the string

#### for example it follows the BADMAS rule:

'hmm' + 3 *'miam' = hmmmiammiammiam

#### it is o-index based systmem
#### index error 
#### if you want to reverse character then you can be used '-' values
#### so this can be manipulated
#### type error---> strings are not be changed
#### range operator will run no matter with whatever found
#### word[:] == word[0:len(word)]
#### so this can be used to make the copy


#### is operator is the same thing or not ...

#### logical operator checks whether it is true or not

#### List are used to compound data
#### List is mutable
#### strings are not mutable



#### .join type function are using the function coded by someone else


## post lunch sessions

#### range() --> range of number

#### important note is such that the last element is avoided

#### Loop in Python

loop is significant in such that it tells through the positions.indentatio matters in the loops. Block in the identation. Tab character is done in that case and it matters. See note 2

#### note: the mac in here is 2.7.8 try to use the newest version

#### the syntax of python is intitutive.And although it can be done with len and other functions. It us akwas good to follow the normal routine.


#### range generates a list of numbers

#### inside a memory it us a iterative

#### x += 1 no space and incements
